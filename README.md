Description
------------
This module adds a Sidebar to the Individual view that shows the XREF (internal id's) for him/her and for all his/her families.

It's important to note that the XREF's can be changed, so the Webtrees user should use them at his/her own risk.

Installation & upgrading
------------------------
Unpack the zip file and place the mitalteli-show-xref folder in the modules_v4 folder of webtrees. Upload the newly added folder to your server. It is activated by default and will work immediately. No additional configuration is required.

Bugs & feature requests
-------------------------
This is a simple module and provided as is. However, if you experience any bugs you can [create a new issue on GitHub][3]. Since this is a simple module, I will be reluctant to accept feature requests.
